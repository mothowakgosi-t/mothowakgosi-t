- 👋 Hi, I’m @mothowakgosi-t
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to build web applications. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basics on web development on Odin. I'm quite excited at the challenge.
- 💞️ Once I am proficient enough to build a proper web application, I'll look forward to collaborations on how to scale and improve it, particularly on issues on security.
- 📫 If you want to chat about anything: thabang.mothowakgosi@gmail.com
